# MorseHorse
A simple Android application written in Java to send Morse code messages using a device's flashlight.

Input text into the code line and send using the BEGIN SIGNALING button.

The menu in the top right corner also has an automatic SOS signal that can be sent nonstop without further intervention. 

App icon was drawn in paint.net by me. I never said I was an artist.
